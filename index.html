      My name is Ryan Whitmire, and I am a Senior Software Engineer at DraftKings.
      I have a passion for programming languages and I'm constantly learning new ways to solve
      old problems. As you can probably tell by the design of this website, I like to keep things simple.
      As much as I enjoy writing code, I find deleting code is equally satisfying.

      Building maintainable software is incredibly important to me. If the things we build break down and
      wake us up in the middle of the night demanding to be fixed immediately, why did we
      build them to begin with? This is no way to live! Write elegant code, acquire sleep.&trade;

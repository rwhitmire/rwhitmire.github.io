<div class="about-me">
	<h2>Who I Am</h2>
	<p>
		My name is Ryan Whitmire and I live in Erie, Pennsylvania. I am remotely employed as a senior software 
		developer at (Velaro)[http://www.velaro.com/] in Elkridge, Maryland. I built my first website when I was 
		12 years old and have loved web development ever since.
	</p>

	<h2>Things I Do</h2>
	<p>
		I've been primarily working with ASP.NET MVC for the majority of my career. I have a good amount of 
		experience in setting up and building new applications from scratch. Angular, Knockout, jQuery, and 
		Underscore are a few of the front-end libraries I use on a daily basis. On the back end, I deal with 
		a lot of C#, SQL Server, Entity Framework, and Ninject. Test driven development is something I'm rather 
		fond of.
	</p>

	<h2>Things I Like</h2>
	<p>
		I love javascript. I take any chance I can get to write code in javascript whether I'm working with 
		the server or the client. Naturally, I'm drawn to Node.js and spend a lot of free time learning how 
		to build things with it. When I'm not writing javascript code, I'm probably playing around with a 
		Raspberry Pi computer. While I primarily program for Windows environments, I understand and enjoy Linux.

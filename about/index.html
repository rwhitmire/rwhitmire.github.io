<div class="about-me">
	<h2>Who I Am</h2>
	<p>
		My name is Ryan Whitmire and I live in Erie, Pennsylvania. I graduated from Edinboro University of Pennsylvania and currently
		work as a software developer at Erie Insurance Group. I built my first website when I was 12 years old and have loved
		web development ever since.
	</p>

	<h2>Things I Do</h2>
	<p>
		I've been primarily working with ASP.NET MVC for the majority of my career. 
	</p>

	<h2>Things I Like</h2>
	<p>
		I love javascript. I take any chance I can get to write code in javascript whether I'm working with the server or the client. Naturally, I'm drawn to Node.js and spend a lot of free time learning how to build things with it. When I'm not writing javascript code, I'm probably playing around with a Raspberry Pi computer.

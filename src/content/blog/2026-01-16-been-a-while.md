I haven't written a blog post in six years. A lot has happened since the stange ages of wearing masks
everywhere. I even took a new job and left it since I posted last. I used AI to convert my entire website
from Jekyll to Astro and I didn't write any of the code. What a time to live. I hope to write more in
the near future.

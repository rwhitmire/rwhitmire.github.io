I started the agent survey email task today and everything was simple and
smooth, right until the very end. Our existing survey email template is just
different enough that we shouldn't try to modify and reuse it. Also, all of
our templates are stored online in a Mandrill account. Additionally, a 2FA code
is sent to an email account I don't have access to. To make things more complicated,
Mandrill went offline for a full day last weekend and we're considering a move
to a different email provider meaning we need to migrate away from their hosted
templates.

The dev team discussed and ultimately decided to work on a solution for designing
and hosting our own email templates. I researched a few solutions. HEML looked
promising at first, but it's missing some features and the repository has been
inactive for nearly 2 years. That's not a good start. We also looked at Foundation
for emails which has nice features, but feels a bit bloated. Will continue research
tomorrow.
